# WBD5204-node_fizzbuzz_practice

Create a very basic node server which accepts a couple of different GET requests and returns different responses in each one.
    Homepage should just say Hello World! But it should also output any data about the user in the console.
     Loop page should output a list of numbers from 1 to 1k, with all odd numbers ommited.
     FizzBuzz page should do a FizzBuzz.
